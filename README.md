# GravitySimulator
 
This project is a simple simulation of Newtons Laws of Universal Gravitation. 

The project is completed and I am not thinking of updating it more. 

There is no UI meaning that if you want to play around with it you will need to play in the code. 
The main parameters you need to play with are the following : 
G is the constant that defignes the strenght of acceleration
The objects with theyr mass, starting position and velocity. 

Sorry if this project is not well documented. I am planning a video to document the project. 

Free to use just give credits.
